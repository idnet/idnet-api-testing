# id.net Oauth API testing

This is a Nodejs testing setup for id.net oauth APIs.

This is meant to be easier than the idnet-example-rails-3 but doesn't yet work with the JS sdk.

To get started:

install Node, if you need it
cd to the idnet-api-testing directory
run 'npm install'
edit index.js with a clientid, secret, and change the site ip to your local server.
run 'node index.js' or use the windows bat file
